# CS-207
These days everything we use is becoming smart. Like the smartphone, smart tv, smart car, smart electronics, etc. In this era of smartness should not the dustbin be smart too? Moreover, the dustbin is a part of our daily life; we all need it to throw the trash of the house. With the simple idea of making a simple dustbin into a smart dustbin I decided to do this project. On the other hand, a smart dustbin may also prove to  be useful for disabled people because the effort to open the lid by hand or leg will not be needed.





I will be replicating the same product of the admin of bestschoolprojects.com and then plan to modify it by adding another ultrasonic sensor to the dustbin which will detect the level of garbage inside it and if the garbage reaches a certain height, a sound will be made using the piezo buzzer thus the owner will understand that the bin is full.
